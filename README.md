Welcome to Caverns Of Fortune, a relaxing card game where treasures, monsters, and magic await you in the depths of a mysterious cavern.

How to Play

**Objective**: Your aim in Caverns Of Fortune is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting treasure points.

**Card Flipping**: At the start of the game, you'll be faced with a grid of twelve facedown cards. Click on a card to reveal what's hidden beneath. But beware, some cards hold monsters that require you to engage in battle, while others hold valuable treasures that boost your score.

**Monsters**: If you uncover a monster card, get ready for. Use your attack action to defeat the monsters. Collect spell books along the way to acquire powerful spells that can help you overcome even the toughest opponents. You can only fight one monster at a time, so all other cards will remain locked during the battle.

**Potions**: Uncovering a potion card grants you the ability to heal. Remember, battles can be tough, so wisely manage your potions to stay in top fighting condition. Use potions strategically to maximize your chances of success. If you potion inventory is already full, the new potion card will be discarded.

**Spell Books**: Spell books are hidden within the caverns, waiting to be discovered. Collect them to unlock powerful spells that can turn the tide of battle in your favor. Use your spell book wisely and choose the perfect moment to unleash its magic against your enemies. If you already have a spell book in your inventory, the new spell book card will be discarded.

**Treasure**: This is your ultimate goal. Uncover them to add to your score and inch closer to becoming a legendary treasure hunter. The more treasure cards you reveal, the higher your score will soar. Challenge yourself to reach new heights and set records!
